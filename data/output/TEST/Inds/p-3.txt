“> Financial Year (Column T) is to be given in YYYY-YYYY format, like 2021-2022 or 2022-2023.

Date in Finacle).

** Loan Sanction Amount and Drawing Limit (Columns V & W) are in INR exact value.

** Please go through the codes given in the master Table and input the correct codes.

* As a healthy practice, branches may opt to click on ‘Generate File’ button on the sheet, after
feeding a few records to ensure that data fed thus far is correct (running this validates all
data in the sheet). Please also remember to save the file periodically.

« After all the information is fed in the excel sheet save the file and click the ‘Generate File’
button.

This will validate the data and ‘Data Validated successfully’ message will be shown.

The message Enter Sol id to generate file for your Sol’ will appear, wherein the SOL id of the
branch has to be input.

Once this is done, a text file, with file name in the format KCCISS_SOLID_DATE_***.txt’ will
be generated and saved in the Desktop of the PC. This text file will then have to be uploaded
to Finacle on the same day, using the Upload option in KCCISS Menu.

On uploading data, the relevant data fields in Finacle will get updated and two report files
will be generated, one for the successfully uploaded records and one for the
rejected/unsuccessful records. Branches can view/print these reports using HPR option.

* Any mismatches/data errors will result in rejection of such records, while uploading to
Finacle and can be seen in the error report.

** Please remember that the error reports will be inclusive of all errors in the newly fed data as
well as data fields already existing in Finacle (which are relevant for KCCISS).

For records requiring rectification at CIF level, the same may be carried out through the
respective Menus like MRCR, CUSTUPDT, HBAIM etc., at the branch level.

** Branches have to rectify all the errors and upload the file again. Rectification and re--
uploading has to be done, till error reports become ‘NIL”. In such manner, details of all
Standard accounts, are to be uploaded in Finacle.

¢» All the successfully uploaded records are then required to be verified by the Branch Officials.

*» Transfer of verified data to the Portal will be completed at the Central level. The successfully
uploaded data will flow through Head Office/CBS and it will be uploaded to the Portal by
Middleware. In the first phase, the details of those accounts which got interest subvention in
the year 2021-22 and eligible for interest subvention during this FY will only be uploaded in
the Portal. On successful upload to the Portal, an Application ID will be generated for each
record and a unique Farmer ID will be generated for each farmer (based on unique Aadhaar
number). Please note that for KCC Joint account holders, unique Farmer ID will be generated
by the portal for the primary holder.

*» In case of Joint account holders branches should ensure to update correct information of
Joint holders including their Aadhaar details in finacle.

If any records are rejected by the Portal, branches can enquire about these through:

e Branch can check the status of an account submitted, through Report generation option
in KCCISS Menu. Report will be generated through HPR.

e Branch can also know the status by entering individual account through inquire option
in KCCISS Menu.

e Application status can be viewed on the KCC-ISS portal through individual branch login.
Please use PMFBY credentials for logging on KCC-ISS portal (https: //fasalrin.gov.in)
through individual branch login. For creation/activation of credentials on KCC-ISS
portal kindly contact concerned state admin i.e Zonal Office PS-Incharge (to create user
credentials for the branches in their jurisdiction).

e Error rectification and re-upload has to be done for such rejected records, if any. As error
rectification will be a time consuming and resource wasting exercise, we request all to
ensure correct data feeding, initially itself.

e Please ensure that the Aadhaar number is correct, as the portal has Aadhaar validation
on real time basis, using a direct link with UIDAI server.

e Rejected records will have to be corrected and uploaded again, till the details for all
eligible KCC accounts have been submitted to the Portal.
