Details of the Menu, Macro file, Process Flow etc.:

In order to facilitate branches to easily upload the information in existing KCC accounts, a
spreadsheet, viz. “KCCISSMacro”, has been developed. All the branches are advised to input
data in the excel sheet, for all their KCC accounts which are now in Standard category and
upload it to Finacle (using KCCISS menu). The System will validate the data uploaded and
generate reports (use HPR to download/view), separately for success and failure of the uploaded
records.

Data of Failure records’ need to be rectified in the KCCISSMacro. Failure of records could also
be due to the incorrect/incomplete/missing data in the existing database. In such cases,
corrections have to be made using the relevant Menus like MRCR, HBAIM CUSTUPDT etc.

The revised file (of failed records only), after making requisite changes, is to be UPLOADED
again and then VERIFIED, as before.

Once the requisite data is successfully uploaded, these data points and the other necessary
data fields, fetched from the existing database, will be put together in the format required by
the Portal and uploaded on the Portal, using API integration (End to end electronic mode). The
indicative fields of “KCCISSMacro” are:
