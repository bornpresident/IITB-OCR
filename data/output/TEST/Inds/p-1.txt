CIRCULAR TO ALL BRANCHES / OFFICES IN INDIA

ISSUED BY RURAL & AGRI BANKING DEPARTMENT

 

 

Dear Sir,

RE: New menu option “KCCISS” in Finacle, for submission of information pertaining to
KCC borrowers, to the KCC-ISS portal of Government of India.

We request reference to circulars, No. BCC:BR:114:322, dated 17.05.2022 and
BCC:BR:114:811, dated 30.11.2022, vide which the Govt. of India’s decision for continuation
of interest subvention scheme (modified) was informed. Two important features of the scheme
are:

e Aadhaar linkage would continue to be mandatory for availing the subvention for short term
loans in 2021-22, 2022-23 and 2023-24.

e All the short term loans processed in 2021-22, 2022-23 and 2023-24, which are eligible for
subvention, are required to be brought on the ISS portal/DBT platform. Lending institutions
have to capture and submit category-wise data of beneficiaries under the Scheme and report

the same on the ISS portal, individual farmer-wise, to settle the audited claims arising from
2021-22 onwards.

We have received a communication from the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare
(DoA&FW), GOI, informing about the development of the integrated digital portal for KCC-
interest subvention scheme. This portal will provide complete access to the granular data of
farmers/borrowers of KCC, including information about loans sanctioned and eligible interest
subvention claims of the bank and will also help to review and monitor the scheme progress
and its utilization. Further, DoA&FW requested all banks to enable requisite electronic data
entry /exchange, for FY 2021-22 & FY 2022-23, on KCC-ISS Portal (https: / /fasalrin.gov.in).

The information sought to be uploaded on the portal is extensive and many of the data points
were not available in Finacle. In order to capture the information to be submitted to the portal,
a new Finacle Menu viz. “KCCISS” has been developed and made Live in Finacle w.e.f. 16
February 2023. In order to facilitate branches to easily upload this information in existing KCC
accounts, a spreadsheet, viz. “KCCISSMacro”, has also been developed. All the branches are
advised to input data in the excel sheet, for all their KCC accounts which are now in Standard
category and upload it to Finacle.

 

The details of the Menu, Macro file, Process Flow, common errors etc. have been provided in the
Annexure to this circular.

Branches are requested to input error free data for all Standard accounts as per the procedure
given, so as to avoid rejection of subvention claims.

This is a time bound exercise and being monitored at the top level, in our Bank and the
Government. We request all the operating units to accord top priority and complete this exercise
by 10.03.2023.

Yours faithfully,

(Nityanahda Behera)
